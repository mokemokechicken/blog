I often search the web wondering what it&amp;rsquo;s like, if it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a hassle, if it&amp;rsquo;s going to cost money, if I can try it out, and so on.

The other 20% is because I was curious about how much advertising income there is from blogs.
The remaining 70% is because I want to donate the money I earn (if I can earn it) as a way to repay the fortune of being in a position where I might be able to earn advertising income (I&amp;rsquo;m serious).</description></item></channel></rss>
